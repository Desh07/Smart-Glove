# Smart Glove Mobile Application (SSL Glove)

## Project Overview
The **Smart Glove Mobile Application (SSL Glove)** is a companion mobile app developed to support a **Smart Glove System** designed for **speech-impaired individuals**. The system converts **Sri Lankan Sign Language (SSL)** gestures into **text and voice output**, enabling easier communication with the general public.

This mobile application acts as the **user interface and control center** for the smart glove, providing real-time feedback, language selection, accessibility features, and user management.
